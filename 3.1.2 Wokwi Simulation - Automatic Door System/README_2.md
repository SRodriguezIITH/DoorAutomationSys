THE FREE VERSION OF WOKWI RESTRICTS IOT USAGE THUS SIMULATING IOT IS NOT POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, I HAVE PROVIDED BOTH CODES WITHIOT AND WITHOUTIOT IMPLEMENTATION.

The WithoutIOT is a working model with an alarm system.
The WithIOT is a theoretical model with Arduino IOT Cloud integration. With Proper Physical ESP32 or PAID Version of WOKWI, this code will work and we get a cloud-iot based alarm system for our door. This folder also contains a thingProperties.h file to configure Arduino IOT Cloud
Each folder above contains the main sketch.ino file.

A diagram.json file has been given to show the Circuit layout in JSON format as shown in WOKWI. Components used can also be found here.

A Report.pdf is also provided.

Thank You.
